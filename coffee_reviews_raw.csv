Notes: Produced by Wilton Benitez of Granja Paraiso 92, entirely of the Yellow Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by the thermal shock method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over-oxidation or continued fermentation. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “Let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.
